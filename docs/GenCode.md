# Generated Code Manual

The generated code have attached references manual automatically. You can view it directly. The manual will tell you how to read and write messages correctly, especially for C++ code. I write a long manual for generated C++ code usage.  
Also, you can get original help annotations from `snippets`, however I am not suggest to do this.  
For C++ programmer, please pay attention to this warning. Because C++ do not have a confirmed code style, so we use "C with classes" style in this project to make sure the max compatibility of generated code. If you feel uncomfortable and want to say, why not use C11, C17 or C20 syntax? I will say, "fuck off and shut up". I will not upgrade any C++ syntax because C++ is a shitty non-standard language. You can open fork freely with proper license if you think I am an idiot.
