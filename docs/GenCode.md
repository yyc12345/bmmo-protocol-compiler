# Generated Code Manual

## Before Reading

Before starting your reading, please allow me introduce the aim of each generated languages. And, a small, arrogant and realistic warning for C
++ code user.

Compiler supports 4 languages now, Python, C#, C++ and Proto. Python code is generated for quick test, small demo and etc. Python code is not ready for production environment.   
Oppositely, C# and C++ code is more suit for your productions. C# code can be used in some game engine easily, such as Unity. C++ code can be applied to game server and etc.  
Proto code generation is a migration way. As I said in readme, if you want to migrate to more stable binary protocol, use this output can let you feel more fluent about migration.

For C++ programmer, please pay attention to this warning. Because C++ do not have a confirmed code style, so we use "C with classes" style in this project to make sure the max compatibility of generated code. If you feel uncomfortable and want to say, why not use C11, C17 or C20 syntax? I will say, "fuck off and shut up". I will not upgrade any C++ syntax because C++ is a shitty non-standard language. You can open fork freely with proper license if you think I am an idiot.
